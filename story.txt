There was boy by the name of robinhood. Robinhood was the hero of a very big
town in Madison, WI. 

One day, Robinhood was wondering on the street, and he saw a little girl begging
for food in front of a coffee shop. The owner of the coffee shop rudly pushed 
her away and threatened to beat her if she came again. Robinhood was so furious 
that she run towards the little girl who is crying like a baby.

The END!!!

Hahhaha!!! You though it was the end of the story didn't you? Robinhood seeing
this injustice acted accordingly. He ran towards the coffee shop owner and yelled
him for threatening the girl. The coffee owner showed no remorse. Robinhood seeing
that the coffee shop owner had no remorse made sure to beat the remorse into him.

As Robinhood walked out of the coffee shop, the owner stumbled back to his
feet and reached for the telephone nearby. "911? Yes I have an emergence. Rob-
inhood physically assaulted me and destoryed my beloved coffee shop!"

"*sigh* He just got out last week after assaulting someone for littering, we'll
be right there". Robinhood was found several blocks away walking confidently and
bragging to passerbys about the "good" that he had done. "Vigilante justice doesn't
fly in modern society Robinhood," lectured the police officer through the bars in his
car as he drove down to the station "I mean, what kind of message does it send to beat
some for the offense of threatening to beat someone!?"
