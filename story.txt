There was boy by the name of robinhood. Robinhood was the hero of a very big town in Madison, WI. 

One day, Robinhood was wondering on the street, and he saw a little girl begging
for food in front of a coffee shop. The owner of the coffee shop rudly pushed 
her away and threatened to beat her if she came again. Robinhood was so furious 
that she run towards the little girl who is crying like a baby.

The END!!!

Hahhaha!!! You though it was the end of the story didn't you? Robinhood seeing
this injustice acted accordingly. He ran towards the coffee shop owner and yelled
him for threatening the girl. The coffee owner showed no remorse. Robinhood seeing
that the coffee shop owner had no remorse made sure to beat the remorse into him.
